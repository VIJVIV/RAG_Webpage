# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model for querying a webpage

This repository provide code to implement a basic RAG model for querying a webpage. The RAG model is implemented purely using open source models, with the help of langchain framework. You would require an api token for accessing hugging face models, which would need to be inserted as password during code execution. This project is a learning exercise, expected to evolve or lead to a more comprehensive project in the (near) future.


Upon code execution, the response generated for query is:

To analyze if model accesses information from webpage correctly and does not halucinate, the context from webpage for respective query is:
